Plasma Voltage Divider

### About the project
An electronic circuit for reading voltage from plasma machines.

Plasma machines output up to 200v. We need a voltage divider to read this voltage and use it in projects such as THC. This circuit gives output between 0 and 5v by dividing the voltage for use in controllers such as Atmega.
